2.3
!! Several config files have formatting changes. Please back up all configs before updating

New Boiler & Icebox Behavior:-
- Added new block: Smokestack
      - A smokestack can be placed on top of these blocks to make them act like a half-power hearth
          - They give up to Insulation V and can only heat or cool, respectively
          - They have about 60% of the radius and much less maximum volume
      - They now produce ambient air particles when fueled and have a smokestack
          - Added a new button to their GUIs to toggle this effect
* The icebox now has an animation/sounds when being used, opening like a chest
- The icebox has a unique texture for when a smokestack is placed on top
- Lava/water can be piped into them, similar to the hearth

Hearth Changes:-
- The hearth has been altered to be a post-Nether block
      - Crafted with nether bricks and soul sand/soil, as well as the new smokestack block
      - All other functionality is the same. This block is now an "upgrade" to the smokestack/boiler/icebox
- The hearth-like blocks now protect against temperature 50% more effectively
      - This means the boiler & icebox have ~75% the effectiveness of the old hearth, and the new hearth is better than before
* Hearth-like blocks (including the boiler and icebox) now require redstone power to emit heat/cold
      - While one of these blocks are powered, they will constantly heat/cool the area and consume fuel
      - The thermolith can be used to detect the nearby temperature and power these blocks dynamically
      * A config option has been added to re-enable the "smart" behavior of these blocks
      - If a hearth is powered from the sides, it will cool the nearby area
      - If a hearth is powered from the back, it will heat the nearby area
      - Powering a hearth from both areas will make it heat and cool
      - Powering a boiler or icebox from any side will make it heat or cool, respectively

Waterskin Changes:-
- Waterskins are now drinkable via sneaking and right-clicking
- Added more info about the filled waterskin's uses to its tooltip
- Waterskins can now fill (and be filled from) cauldrons
- Added custom filling and pouring sounds for the waterskin

Chameleon Changes:-
* Chameleons can now be given items by right-clicking
      - Aside from being intuitive, this is a way of ensuring which chameleon will eat the item if there are multiple nearby. Only the chosen chameleon will attempt to eat the item
* Tamed chameleons can now be bred using their normal taming items (fish, spider eye), but only once
      - This is to make chameleons slightly easier to obtain, and help with potential scarcity on large servers
      - Baby chameleons shed chameleon molt immediately upon turning in to an adult, but otherwise don't
- Chameleons now drop 1 chameleon molt when killed, except if they are a baby
- Made baby chameleons slightly smaller
- Slightly decreased the rate at which chameleons shed

Loot Changes:-
- Increased hoglin hide drop rate to between 1 and 3 (from 1)
- Chameleon molt dropped from chameleons now lasts 20 minutes before despawning
- Significantly reduced the drop rate of sticks from soul stalk blocks

Ice Changes:-
* The hearth & icebox now no longer accept water by default
      - Now, the primary cold fuel source is ice
* Ice is now much easier to obtain/farm, due to a few key changes:
      - Ice now freezes/thaws according to Cold Sweat's temperature system
      - This new system takes altitude, time, and the season into account
      - Ice freezes at roughly 32 °F (0 °C)
      - Ice can now be obtained with a stone pickaxe without silk touch
            - An iron pickaxe is required for packed ice and blue ice
            - If ice is mined with a wooden pickaxe or by hand, it will turn into water as normal
      - Packed and Blue ice can now be un-crafted into their "lower-level" variants (i.e. blue ice yields packed ice) in the crafting table or stonecutter
            - The crafting table yields 4 ice blocks, while the stonecutter yields 9
- Ice and snow now have slightly lower fuel values in the icebox and hearth

UI Changes:-
* The "vague" temperature gauge (world temperature gauge without a thermometer) has been turned into a frame around the body temperature icon
      - Functionality is the same; these UI elements have just been combined to make the UI less cluttered. It looks pretty good, too!
      - The exact world temperature readout will still be shown as normal when the player has a thermometer
* The body temperature readout is now hidden unless a thermometer is equipped
      - Instead, the body temperature icon will now gradually fill up, turning either orange or blue as the player's temperature increases/decreases
- Added new "compact" view for insulation tooltips with 10 bars of insulation or more

Mod Compatibility:-
* (1.20) Added Origins integration as a standalone mod:
      - Allows for users to modify the attribute values that players spawn with for origins via datapacks or config files
      - This could already be done for your own origins via attribute modifiers, but this addon is useful for modpack devs
* Added support for Thirst Was Taken:
      - Purity defaults to "Slightly Dirty"
      - Can be purified by the same means as water bottles (furnace, campfire)
            - This does not affect the temperature of the waterskin, only its purification level
      - Drinkable items can now be purified in the boiler:
            - When a waterskin is up to max temperature (120 F / 48 C), it will purify by one level every 10 seconds
            - Other drinkable items don't need to heat up. They will start purifying immediately
            - Purification rate is also affected by the configured temperature rate
- Waterskins can now be filled by Create machines with 250mb of water
* Added better support for netherite diving gear from Create
      - A complete netherite diving suit (Create) now provides complete resistance to block-related temperature (like lava!)
            - It also gives 100% resistance to overheating, so your temperature will not increase
            - These effects last until the backtank is empty
      - The backtank will now drain air (and show the time indicator) when the player is in a hot environment
      - This leverages the new entity predicate system added in this update
- Added Primal Winter support by default
* (1.20) Added Weather, Storms & Tornadoes (Weather2) support
* Aquamirae three-bold armor set now provides some freezing protection, as well as water immunity
* Added support for Spoiled:
      - Placing food items in the icebox will stop food spoilage as long as it is fueled
      - This will gradually drain fuel from the icebox
- Added support for using a Create display link on the thermolith
      - The current world temperature will be displayed
      - A field will be added upon placing the display link that allows the user to define the temperature units

Misc. Changes:-
* Added "Cold Sweat: Insulators" creative tab
      - Contains all items that can be used as insulation, or provide insulation when worn
* Shift-clicking an armor item from the output slot of the sewing table now applies all available insulation at once
- Removed the Insulated effect from the list of top-tier beacon effects
- The inside of naturally-generated igloos is now habitable
- The soulspring lamp can now be given one fuel item at a time by right-clicking
- Improved the output formatting for the /temp debug command
- Made heatstroke camera swaying more aggressive
- Increased the duration of the soul sprout's effect to 1 minute
- The soulspring lamp now emits particles while in use to help signify its area of effect
- Lava cauldrons now emit heat by default
      ! This will not take effect until the config setting for block temperatures is reset
- Reduced the food value of soul sprouts to 3 (from 4), and the saturation to 0.5 (from 1)


Config Changes:
- Due to many configs requiring access to world registries, the Cold Sweat config button is now disabled in the main menu
* Config settings can now accept a comma-separated list of biomes, dimensions, or structures to apply the same settings to multiple things
* The following config settings now have a configurable range of intensity, instead of just on/off:
      - Freezing hearts: Ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 freezing all hearts
      - Chilled mining speed: Ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 preventing the player from mining completely
      - Chilled movement speed: Ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 preventing the player from moving completely
      - Chilled knockback reduction: Ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 nullifying the player's knockback to other entities
      - Heatstroke fog: Ranges from 0 to infinity; Controls the distance of the fog, with infinity disabling it altogether
      * These settings now have entries in the config menu as well
* Added config option for setting the temperature of natural structures
      - This controls the world temperature when the player is inside the structure
* Added config option for armor insulation slots to dynamically scale based on protection value:
      - There are 4 modes: Static (no scaling), Linear, Exponential, and Logarithmic
      - A maximum number of slots can be set to prevent excessive scaling
- Added config option to allow certain blocks to be slept on regardless of the outside temperature
- The temperature rate config setting now affects how fast waterskins heat/cool in the boiler and icebox
* Most item configs now support defining NBT tags (i.e. {Color:"blue"}).
      - Item configs with NBT tags defined will require the specified NBT data to be present on the item
* Added the option for food items to change the player's temperature for a period of time, like soul sprouts
- Moved the "Cold Soul Fire" and "Check Sleep Conditions" settings to world-settings.toml
- Renamed some too-verbose config settings/sections
- Added new config option to smooth out how rapidly changing temperatures are represented by the world temperature gauge
      - In other words, the gauge won't jitter as much when the player is moving around near heat sources
      - This option is defaulted to 10, double the smoothing of previous versions
* Added option to hide individual UI elements in the config menu
- Altered/touched up the config screen in a few other areas
- The soulspring lamp can now be given one fuel item at a time by right-clicking
- Added structure temperature offset config option
- Added config setting to change the drop rate of chameleon molt


Technical Changes:
* Added support for defining config settings using JSON:
      - This is a more modular way of configuring things, without having to add them to the config files
      * It can be defined by mod developers in the data files, or via datapacks:
            - Insulation: data/<yourmod>/cold_sweat/item/insulator
            - Fuel items: .../item/fuel
            - Food temperatures: .../item/food
            - Block Temps: .../block/block_temp
            - Biome Temps: .../world/biome_temp
            - Dimension Temps: .../world/dimension_temp
            - Structure temperatures: .../world/structure_temp
            - Temperature regions: .../world/depth_temp
            - Insulating mounts: .../entity/mount
            - Entity spawn biomes: .../entity/spawn_biome
      * It can also be placed in the user config folder (config/coldsweat/data/*) to be globally applied (i.e. config/coldsweat/data/insulator)
      * Insulation items have additional functionality when defined in JSON:
            - They can now contain entity predicates:
                - Insulation items with a predicate will only provide insulation if the wearer has the specified data
                      - Deactivated insulation items can still be equipped, but will not provide insulation or show in the tooltip
                      - This is a new system, but is structured like a Vanilla entity predicates with some slight tweaks
            - They can now give attribute modifiers:
                  - Attribute modifiers will be applied when the insulation item is on a piece of armor
                  - Any attributes (even Vanilla and modded ones) are supported
      * Config settings have a set order of precedence depending on how they are defined:
            - user datapacks (in config folder) > datapacks (from mods or worlds) > traditional configs (.toml files)
      ! Datapack configs are read slightly differently in 1.16:
            - Data files are kept in data/cold_sweat/config/* instead of data/<yourmod>/cold_sweat/*
                  - Otherwise, the internal structure is the same
                  ! Datapacks in world folders still can't be read by this system. The alternative is to put datapack configs in configs/coldsweat/data/*
      * More info on this system is available on the mod's documentation site; a link to which is on the CurseForge or Modrinth page
* Insulation items can now affect non-player entities
      - If an insulation item has special properties, like attribute modifiers, it will now apply to any entity, not just players
* Insulation items can now make entities immune to certain TempModifiers
      - This reduces the efficacy of the specified TempModifiers on the entity
      - The the entity requirement must be met for immunity to be applied
* Added block tags for hearth spread whitelist/blacklist (cold_sweat:tags/block/hearth/spread_whitelist and spread_blacklist)
* Added block tag for blocks that should ignore sleeping conditions (cold_sweat:tags/block/ignore_sleep_check) (ignore the "Check Sleeping Conditions" setting)
* Added item tag for non-insulatable armor items (cold_sweat:tags/item/not_insulatable)
* Added effect tag for blacklisted potion effects in the hearth (cold_sweat:tags/mob_effect/hearth_blacklisted)
* Temperature.Type and Ability have been merged together into Trait
      - These two things were functionally identical anyway, so separating them only made them more annoying to work with
      - This also means that previous Temperature.Ability types can now have TempModifiers applied to them
- The TempModifier registration system has been slightly changed:
      - The ID for TempModifiers is no longer provided by a method in the TempModifier class
      - IDs are now assigned at registration via ResourceLocations like most other things
- The Temperature.addModifier() method will now add/replace for every TempModifier instance that matches the given predicate if allowDupes is true
* All methods that add/remove/replace TempModifiers now have more advanced options for handling duplicates:
      - This replaces the old "allowDupes" parameter
      - ALLOW: Allows duplicates of this TempModifier to exist on the entity
      - BY_CLASS: Adding/replacing a TempModifier fails if one of the same class is already present
      - EXACT: Adding/replacing a TempModifier fails if there is an instance of the same class and matching NBT present
      ! The old methods with the "allowDupes" parameter are still present, but are now deprecated and marked for removal in a future version
- Replaced TempModifierEvent.Calculate.Pre and Post with more useful events:
      - Override: Fires before the TempModifier is calculated, and allows the incoming temperature to be changed
            - If the event is canceled, the TempModifier's output will be overridden with the event's temperature until it is calculated again
            - Otherwise, the event's temperature is passed into the TempModifier for calculation
      - Modify: Fires after the TempModifier is calculated, and allows the resulting function to be modified
            - The event is not cancelable
* Some config settings now require a RegistryAccess when saving, loading, or getting (see ConfigSettings.java)
* Added an automatic config updater, which will change existing config settings when updating to new versions
     - This prevents outdated config settings causing new features to not work as intended
     - This system will be used very sparingly, and only triggers once
