------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Beta 1
- New Item: Soulfire Lamp
    - Cools the player down when in the Nether
    - Requires Warped or Crimson stems as fuel (temporarily; will be changed to a custom item in the future)
- The Hearth now only consumes the necessary fuel to function
    - If it is hot, for example, it will only use cold fuel
    - The Hearth will not use any fuel if there are no players in the area
    - If the temperature in the area is habitable, the Hearth will not use any fuel
- Limited the number of total blocks the Hearth can affect to 2000
    - This replaces the 20-block radius that it used to have
    - increased the technical radius to 64 blocks
    - (note that it can't actually fill the entire 64-block radius, but it can reach these distances if you make a tunnel for the hearth to spread through)
- Leather armor now insulates based on what piece of armor it is (configurable)
    - i.e. a leather chestplate insulates more than a leather helmet
- Updated the Hearth's texture slightly
- Added Polish translation by @Lifus_Crustus on our Discord server
- Added Portuguese translation by @Joymachs and @Vellar on our Discord server
- Fixed multiple bugs with the Hearth that would cause it to not detect ceilings or solid blocks properly

            - Called when the registry of TempModifiers or BlockTemps is being built
            - Allows for injection of custom TempModifiers and BlockTemps
            - If you call this event manually, use getPool().flush() beforehand to prevent duplicate entries (lag)
    - The Hearth now uses the capability system instead of NBT
            - This should increase performance and prevent issues with the NBT data limit on some servers
    - "fuel_items.toml" config file changes:
        - Renamed to "item_settings.toml" to better indicate that it also includes insulation items
        - Insulation items (for the sewing table) and armor items with innate insulation are now defined separately

            - Has two phases:
                - Pre: Called before getValue() is called
                    - Cancellable (Modifier will be skipped)
                - Post: Called after getValue() is called
    - When creating TempModifiers, override the getValue() method now instead of calculate()
        - Calculate is still used when referencing the modifier's value, but it also posts to TempModifierEvent.Tick
    - Replaced all temperature unit conversion methods with on method: MathHelperCS.convertUnits()
        - arguments: (double) value: a double representing the temperature to convert
                     (Unit) from: the unit to convert from (Unit is a new enum in net.momostudios.util)
                     (Unit) to: the unit to convert to
                     (boolean) absolute: if true, the offset of world temperature is taken into account (for example, adds 32 degrees when converting Minecraft to Fahrenheit)

        - It now must have over 3/4 of an item's fuel value missing to consume fuel
    - Now plays a sound when it runs out of the needed fuel type
    - The Hearth's code is now up to 800x more efficient (~20,000-40,000ms -> ~50-200ms of lag over 60 seconds)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.1
- Changed the recipe of the Soulfire Lamp to require a golden nugget at the top
- Revised the icons for all three potion effects (some more than others)
- The Icebox now has much clearer visual indication for when it has fuel (new particles / texture)
- The end is now slightly warmer (it's still uninhabitable, but you can stay there a lot longer now)
- Custom particles now respect the player's particle settings ("minimal" setting disables all custom particles)
- You no longer have to sneak to equip a minecart with insulation

- Added Chinese translation courtesy of 6371peter on GitHub

Fixes:

- Fixed the Soulfire Lamp & Waterskins "bobbing" randomly when held
- Fixed HUD-related crash that occurred in some rare scenarios
- Fixed beds restoring the player's temperature without actually sleeping in it

Technical Changes:
- The Hearth no longer gives Insulation to players in habitable areas
- The Hearth now uses block bounding box shape for spread detection (much more reliable)
- Rebalanced block temperatures to have differing areas of effect


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.2
- The Soulfire Lamp is now the Hellspring Lamp
      - Nothing serious has changed, but this rework brings it into closer parity with its crafting recipe
      - The ID has changed, but don't worry! Old worlds should update to the new ID automatically
      - Translation keys have changed, meaning its name will default to "Hellspring Lamp" in all languages
- Lowered the rate at which the Hearth consumes fuel
- Added compatibility for Better Weather
- The world temperature gauge now smooths out transitions on a per-frame basis instead of per-tick
      - This basically just makes it smoother for higher framerates

Fixes:
- Fixed major underlying bug with armor insulation that made it not work properly
- Fixed crash that occurs when the Hearth is near an unloaded chunk


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.3
- The effects of temperature-emitting are now blocked if there are solid blocks in the way
- Added config option to insulate all non-living rideable entities (so you would be insulated inside a modded plane, for example)
- Rebalanced a lot of Overworld biome temperatures (requires deleting world-temperatures.toml)
- Translation improvements:
      - Some elements of the config GUI will now move around/stretch to accommodate longer words
      - Removed a lot of repetitive translation keys & cleaned them up, making translating much easier (we've updated all existing languages)
      - Fixed some outdated translation keys (Russian, Polish)
      - Fixed some things in the config GUI not updating after changing the language (like ON/OFF labels)
- Added the ability to right-click fuel items into the Boiler, Icebox, and Hearth right from your hand
- Going into caves will now have a much more smooth/noticeable effect on temperature thanks to a much smarter (and more efficient) algorithm
      - The amount of temperature-dampening depends on how far you are from an opening to the surface (natural light) and your y level (deeper is better)
      - As a result of this new system, shade (kind of) helps against extreme temperatures
- It is now possible to add temperature-affecting blocks via configs

Fixes:
- Fixed insulated minecarts dropping Minecart Insulation upon loading the world, allowing for duplication

Technical Changes:
- TempModifiers can now be queued to expire automatically by calling TempModifier#expire(int ticks) when adding it to the player

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.9-b01
- Updated to 1.18.1
- Updated the Hearth's model, texture, item, etc. to look more "primitive" and less like a modern machine
- Tweaked Waterskins to show more realistic temperatures when filled
- Inserting fuel into the Hellspring Lamp is now handled by mixins to prevent client having power over the server
    - The client was possibly able to "spawn in" a fake fuel item, then insert it into the lantern, and the server would accept it

Fixes:
- Waterskins now properly sample the biome's temperature when being filled (this has been broken since at least 2.1)
- Fixed Minecart Insulation being consumed when right-clicking a minecart with insulation already applied

Technical Changes:
- The Hearth no longer uses the capability system (shouldn't impact anything in-game)
- Many of the utility classes have been re-worked or removed. This will require compat mods to be updated.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.9-b02
- Fixed crash caused by Serene Seasons


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.9-b03
- Fixed various crashes that would occur during server startup
- Fixed a rare crash that would occur when a block was removed in the world
- Fixed bug that caused the Sewing GUI to pull its title from the wrong translation key


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.9-b04

- Changed how Cold Sweat rearranges the hotbar to make it more compatible with mods that also change the hotbar
- Updated Hearth and empty Waterskin item textures to be more distinctive
- Increased the effective range of the Hellspring Lamp by 1.5 blocks (hopefully it's easier to share now!)

Fixes:

- Fixed "Arrow of Ice Resistance" not having a translation key
- Fixed biomes that don't exist anymore appearing in world-temperatures.toml
- Fixed potential bug that could cause problems with multiple Hearths in the world
- Fixed buggy behavior when walking through soul fire
- Fixed references to "soulfire_lamp" in some files/filenames
- Fixed some TempModifiers triggering every tick when they shouldn't on the clientside
- Fixed TempModifiers ticking on the clientside when the game is paused

Technical Changes:
- All Temperature-related classes have been moved to a new "api" package (including TempModifiers, BlockTemps, etc.)
- Custom events have been moved to the "api" package as well
- Two new Temperature types have been added:
    - HOTTEST: Controls the maximum bearable temperature for the entity
    - COLDEST: Controls the minimum bearable temperature for the entity
    - These are an offset applied to their respective values in the config
    - Can be affected by TempModifiers, manipulated using PlayerHelper, etc.
- BlockTemps can now define which blocks they are attached to in the class's constructor instead of using hasBlock()
    - Please use this when possible, as it is dramatically faster


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.9-b05
- The body temperature indicator now smoothly blends between stages (because it looks cool)
- Soul fire now gives you the powder snow freezing effect when you stand in it, making it deadly again

Fixes:
- Fixed a bug that prevented body temperature from working properly
- Fixed Soulfire not cooling down the surrounding area
- Fixed the item name hotbar overlay interfering with other UI elements
- Fixed some elements in the config menu not moving to accommodate longer strings of text

Technical Changes:
- Renamed PlayerHelper to TempHelper
      - All non-temperature-related methods have been moved from TempHelper to a new PlayerHelper class
- Events and methods for registering TempModifiers and BlockTemps have been moved/renamed to make it more intuitive
- TempModifier arguments can now be cast in a cleaner way with type arguments
      - ex: this.<Double>getArgument("my_argument") casts the returned argument to a double (CANNOT cast to primitives)
      - Because of this, the old getArgument(String id, Class clazz) method has been removed
      - This should also clear up a lot of issues with using primitives vs. classes (i.e. int vs. Integer)
- When registering TempModifiers/BlockTemps, the event is automatically wrapped in a try/catch block that alerts the user that registration has failed


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.10-b01
- Backported as much content as possible from 1.18.x to 1.16.5
- Players can no longer sleep when their body temperature or the world's temperature is deadly

Technical Changes:
- Backend parity between versions (especially for API-related things)
- Moved some BlockTemps to the config (ice, fire, magma blocks, and some others)
- Renamed HOTTEST and COLDEST temperature types to simply "MAX" and "MIN"
- Moved MixinWorld (1.16.5)/MixinLevel (1.18.x) to Forge event system (might help with problems importing Cold Sweat into a workspace)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.10-b02
- The player's hand is now rendered in 1st person when holding the Hellspring Lamp
- The Hellspring Lamp now works a bit differently:
      - Instead of decreasing the world's temperature, it now increases the maximum habitable temperature to  ~135 by default
      - No longer consumes more fuel in hotter areas

Fixes:
- Fixed crash when launching server
- Fixed abnormal lag caused by temperature-emitting blocks

Technical Changes:
- Inserting fuel into the Hellspring Lamp is now handled by mixins to prevent client having power over the server (1.16.5)
    - The client was possibly able to spawn in a fake fuel item, then insert it into the lamp and the server would accept it
- Improved client-server temperature syncing
      - Temperature is now only synced when there is an update, instead of every other tick
      - Player body temperature is now synced less often, and it is smoothed out on the clientside to account for this
      - Temperature can no longer be manually synced using setTemperature() or addTemperature() because of this system


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.10-b04
- Added config option to revert Soul Fire back to dealing burning damage
- Notable backend optimizations by not sending as many packets around. This should help servers a lot!

      - A graphic of the armor's insulation will display in the item's tooltip
      - There are now multiple types of insulation items:
            - Leather: Provides an equal amount of hot and cold insulation
            - Goat Fur: Provides strong cold insulation
            - Hoglin Hide: Provides strong hot insulation
      - Leather armor can still be sewed to armor, filling all of its insulation slots
      - Insulation items can be combined in different ways for more specific use-cases
      - Because there are now two types of insulation, some configs have been changed to match
        (not deleting the old ones may cause a crash)

            - Chameleon molt will have important uses in future updates, so don't throw it away!
- Items that can be used as insulation now have a tooltip displaying their effects
- Insulation tooltips are now more clear about positive/negative insulation values
- the Thermometer can now be equipped as a charm if Curios is installed

      - Rebalanced several biomes' temperatures to be more accurate in Cold Sweat's temperature system
      - Chameleons can now spawn in BYG biomes
      ! 'world-settings.toml' and 'entity-settings.toml' will need to be deleted for these changes to take effect

- Fuel items for the soulspring lamp can now be configured to give different amounts of fuel
- When a block is changed near a hearth, only the parts of the hearth's area-of-effect that stem from that block will be updated
      - For example, if a door is closed, only the area through the door will be updated
- Retextured the top of the sewing table to look less like a crafting table
- The soulspring lamp can now be used more offensively, stealing up to 8 health from a target on attack. This can only be done once per entity

Fixes:
- Fixed crash when hovering over insulation items in certain cases
- Fixed chameleon ambient/hurt sounds not following the entity's position (Vanilla Minecraft bug)

      - "cold_sweat:block_affects_temperature":
            - Triggered when a nearby block affects the player's temperature
            - Arguments for distance, block type, and the total effect this block type has had on the player
      - "cold_sweat:soul_lamp_fueled":
            - Triggered when the player fuels a soulspring lamp

            - Relation (BEFORE, AFTER, or REPLACE)
            - Order (FIRST, LAST)
            - Predicate<TempModifier>
            - The method will scan through the list of modifiers on the entity (in reverse order if Relation is LAST) and find the first modifier that matches the Predicate
                  - It will insert the new modifier before or after this modifier, or replace it, depending on the Relation
      - A Temperature.Addition is created like so:
            - Temperature.Addition.of(AFTER, LAST, modifier -> modifier instanceof MyTempModifier)
            - This example will place the newly inserter TempModifier after the last instance of MyTempModifier in the entity's list of TempModifiers

2.2 (So far)
! Existing armor items using the old insulation format (from pre-2.2) will be automatically updated to the new insulation format. However:
      ! The new insulation format cannot be read by older versions, so if you downgrade Cold Sweat again all item insulation will be lost
      ! Even though this update should be fine to simply drop into an existing world, it is still recommended to back up your world first

Revamped Armor Insulation System:
      - Each piece of armor has a number of slots that can be filled with insulation
      - A graphic of the armor's insulation will display in the item's tooltip

            - Leather: Provides an equal amount of hot and cold insulation
            - Goat(1.18+) or Llama(1.16) Fur: Provides strong cold insulation
            - Hoglin Hide: Provides strong hot insulation
            - Wool: Provides insulation at a half-step between leather and goat fur
            - Rabbit Hide: Provides insulation at a half-step between leather and hoglin hide

      - The number of insulation slots in helmets, chestplates, leggings, and boots is now configurable
      - All wearable items can now have insulation, instead of just armor

      - Their texture has been tweaked to better incorporate this
- Hoglins now drop Hoglin Hide when killed, in addition to their other drops

Soulspring Lamp Changes:
- The Soulspring Lamp can now be fuelled by attacking an entity at full health with it
      - This restores up to 4 fuel
      - Only works once per entity, forever
- When 'Shift' is held, the Soulspring Lamp's tooltip will now show a graphic of what items it can be fuelled with

            - Reduced view distance at temperatures above 50 (less range as temperature increases)
            - Blurred vision as temperature increases above 50
            - Randomly drifting camera as temperature increases above 50
      - Cold (dangerous to the player):
            - Reduced mining/movement speed (slower as temperature decreases)

Technical Changes:
- "Temperature" is no longer an object type
      - All instances of Temperature have been replaced by double values
      - Replaced "with()" with the static method "Temperature.apply()"
      - Because all methods in Temperature are now static, the class has been merged with TempHelper (new class is named Temperature)
- TempModifiers now have a full CompoundTag attached to each instance
      - This can be used to store any custom data that needs to be saved
      - Replaces the old "arguments" system
- TempModifier registration is now done using suppliers of TempModifiers
    - This makes for a less hacky backend way of instantiating TempModifiers, no longer requiring a default constructor
- Renamed methods in TempHelper (Temperature):
      - "getTemperature()" -> "get()"
      - "setTemperature()" -> "set()"
      - "addTemperature()" -> "add()"
- Added new method getTemperatureAt(BlockPos, Level)
        - As you probably could have guessed, this method returns the world's temperature at the given position (using Cold Sweat's default TempModifiers)
- Revamped the temperature system to allow all living entities to have their own temperatures
      - Although the system has been reworked in the backend, there is very little difference in implementation aside from some method parameters
      - This may pave the way for livestock temperature to make a return in the future\
- Added new event: EntityPickEvent
        - Fired when the player uses pick-block (middle-click) on an entity
        - Allows for changing the ItemStack returned
- Added new sub-command for /temperature: "showmodifiers"
      - Displays all of the temperature modifiers present on an entity, as well as how each one affects the entity's temperature
- Added #boiler_valid and #icebox_valid tags
    - These tags now determine what items can be placed into the top slots of the icebox & boiler
- Added tags for items that the chameleon can eat:
    - #chameleon/find_hot_biomes: The chameleon will locate the nearest hot biome
    - #chameleon/find_cold_biomes: The chameleon will locate the nearest cold biome
    - #chameleon/find_humid_biomes: The chameleon will locate the nearest humid biome
    - #chameleon/taming: Item used to tame a chameleon
- Added #soulspring_lamp_valid tag to define dimensions that the soulspring lamp will activate in
- New "HeatResistance" and "ColdResistance" NBT tags can now be applied to players for easy temperature resistance
      - Slows the rate at which the player's temperature changes, similar to armor insulation
      - Setting either of these values to 100 will make the player completely immune to that temperature

Configs:
- Added a config option to disable the mod preventing sleep if the player is too hot/cold
- Fuel items for the soulspring lamp can now be configured to give different amounts of fuel
- Block Temperatures can now be given a "predicate", which makes the block emit/not emit temperature based on its state (i.e. a campfire being lit)
- The Cold Sweat config button can now be repositioned on the screen (option in the config menu)
- Compacted & reworded some config settings to fit better in the menu
- Hovering over config options to show the tooltip is now more consistent
- The "Block Temperatures" config option has been moved to world-settings.toml
    ! This will delete existing configs in main.toml. Back them up first!
- Added new config option in item-settings.toml to "blacklist" items from allowing insulation
- Added a config option to change the amount that temperature equalizes underground


Translation Updates:
- Added Brazilian Portuguese translation (by @Vellar on Discord)
- Updated Chinese translation (by @wumeng on Discord)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Release (changes since 2.2-b05f)
- Soul stalk can now generate with a patch disk of soul sand underneath, allowing it to generate in almost any biome
      - This should help with its reliability and make it more accessible to newer players
- Foods with temperature values assigned via configs now have a tooltip displaying their effects

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.1

Technical Changes:
- (1.20) Changed how some mixins work to make the mod compatible with older versions of Forge (pre-47.1.14)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.2
- Added a high contrast option, which simplifies and adds symbols to UI elements for better readability
      - Can be toggled in the config menu

Fixes:
- (1.16) Fixed crash when paired with mods that change entity models (like Epic Fight)
- (1.20) Fixed crash when taking burning/freezing damage
- (1.19.4) Fixed crash due to mixin mapping issue
- (1.19.4) Fixed tooltips not rendering

Technical Changes:
- (1.20) Changed to NeoForge
- Added a ton of attributes for developers to use:
      - cold_dampening: Slows the rate at which the player freezes. Negative values accelerate it.
      - heat_dampening: Slows the rate at which the player overheats. Negative values accelerate it.
      - burning_point_offset: Applies an offset to the player's maximum habitable world temperature.
      - freezing_point_offset: Applies an offset to the player's minimum habitable world temperature.
      - cold_resistance: A multiplier applied to incoming freezing damage (from 0 to 1, with 1 being full resistance).
      - heat_resistance: A multiplier applied to incoming burning damage (from 0 to 1, with 1 being full resistance).
      - core_temperature_offset: An offset applied to the player's core temperature every tick.
      - base_temperature_offset: An offset that is added to the player's body temperature. This can be applied once and the offset is persistent.
      - world_temperature_offset: Applies an offset to the player's perceived world temperature.
      The following attributes are read-only values that mirror the player's temperatures:
      - world_temperature: The player's current world temperature.
      - burning_point: The player's maximum habitable world temperature.
      - freezing_point: The player's minimum habitable world temperature.
      - core_temperature: The player's core body temperature.
      - base_temperature: The player's base body temperature.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.3
- Multiple hearth updates:
      - Updated model to be more "Minecraft-y"
      - Added standard fluid support:
            - Water and lava can now be piped into the sides (except the face) or bottom of the block
            - Water can be extracted from the sides (except the face), and lava can be extracted from the bottom
      - Adjusted the fuel values of some cold items. Clay and water are now much more effective
            ! 'item-settings.toml' will need to be deleted for this change to take effect
- Curios can now be configured to provide insulation

Fixes:
- Fixed missing lang entries for custom attributes (Cadentem on Discord)
- Fixed crash when porting existing worlds from Cold Sweat 2.1 to 2.2
- (1.16) Fixed llama fur not growing after being sheared
- Fixed issue when using the "getTemperatureAt()" method after the player has quit and re-joined a world
- Fixed Create pipes still requiring a roof to transmit hearth air

Technical Changes:
- The default TempModifiers an entity gets upon spawning are now configurable via GatherDefaultTempModifiersEvent
- Setting the cold_resistance or heat_resistance attributes to 100 will now cause that temperature to not affect the player at all, rather than just slowing its effect to 0


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.4
- Changed the hearth recipe to better reflect its new design
- Adjusted the protection & durability values for fur and hoglin armor to make them much more viable to actually wear
      - New protection values (helmet, chest, legs, boots):

            - Fur: 2 5 4 1
      - Doubled durability
- Further adjustments to default fuel items for icebox, boiler, and hearth:
      - Added logs and planks to the list of burnable items

- (1.19, 1.18, 1.16) Fixed chameleon appearing to float over the player's head when being carried
- Fixed texture inconsistencies between the normal and frosted variants of the icebox

Technical Changes:

      ! This will delete existing configs in main.toml. Back them up first!

Translation Updates:
- Updated Russian translation (by @rey_zex on Discord)
- Updated Italian translation (by @sniper_foxy on Discord)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.5

Fixes:
- Fixed mounts not providing insulation effectively when configured to do so

- The "Insulated Entities" config setting now works on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 being 100% insulation


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.5.1

Fixes:
- Fixed server crash due to invalid class being loaded


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b01a
- Added hearth-like functionality to the boiler and icebox:
      - Added new block: Smokestack
      - A smokestack can be placed on top of these blocks to make them act like a half-power hearth
            - They give up to Insulation V and can only heat or cool, respectively
            - They have about 60% of the radius and much less maximum volume
      - They now produce ambient air particles when fueled and have a smokestack
            - Added a new button to their GUIs to toggle this effect
      - Lava/water can be piped into them, similar to the hearth
- The hearth has been altered to be a post-Nether block
      - Crafted with nether bricks and basalt, as well as the new smokestack block
      - The texture has been changed accordingly
      - All other functionality is the same. This block is now an "upgrade" to the smokestack/boiler/icebox
- Added new config option to smooth out how rapidly changing temperatures are represented by the world temperature gauge
      - In other words, the gauge won't jitter as much when the player is moving around near heat sources
      - This option is defaulted to 10, double the smoothing of previous versions
- Added option to hide individual UI elements in the config menu
- Altered/touched up the config screen in a few other areas
- Added Primal Winter support by default
- (1.20) Added Weather, Storms & Tornadoes (Weather2) support


Fixes:
- Fixed insulation tooltips not showing when Legendary Tooltips is installed
- (1.19.2) Fixed resulting item being invisible when shearing insulation from armor
- Fixed dimension temperature configs not being converted correctly internally, resulting in unpredictable behavior
- Fixed text in certain HUD elements not scaling correctly at some resolutions
- Fixed armor attributes not being taken into account when calculating its built-in insulation


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b02a
- The "vague" temperature gauge (world temperature gauge without a thermometer) has been turned into a frame around the body temperature icon
      - Functionality is the same; these UI elements have just been combined to make the UI less cluttered. It look pretty good, too!
      - The exact world temperature readout will still be shown as normal when the player has a thermometer
- The body temperature readout is now hidden by default
      - This UI element may or may not be staying. It might possibly be locked behind the thermometer in future versions
      - It can be turned back on in the config menu
      - Instead, the body temperature icon will now gradually fill up as the player's temperature increases/decreases
- The temperature rate config setting now affects how fast waterskins heat/cool in the boiler and icebox
- Added support for Thirst Was Taken:
      - Waterskins are now drinkable via right-click
      - Their normal (pour) behavior has been changed to left-click
      - Purity defaults to "Slightly Dirty"
      - Can be purified by the same means as water bottles (furnace, campfire)
            - This does not affect the temperature of the waterskin, only its purification level
      - Drinkable items can now be purified in the boiler:
            - When a waterskin is up to max temperature (120 F / 48 C), it will purify by one level every 10 seconds
            - Other drinkable items don't need to heat up. They will start purifying immediately
            - Purification rate is also affected by the configured temperature rate
- Waterskins can now be filled by Create components (250mb of water)
- The hearth-like blocks now protect against temperature 50% more effectively
      - This should provide a needed buff to the icebox/boiler and make the hearth more worth it

Fixes:
- Fixed the smokestack not having a recipe
- Fixed clientside settings attempting to load on dedicated servers
- (1.20) Fixed soul stalk not dropping items when broken
- Fixed world temperature changing slightly when sitting in a minecart due to the player's hitbox being in the ground
- Fixed boiler/icebox not saving insulation strength upon world reload
- Fixed filled waterskin having a very long tooltip when the temperature rate is set to certain values
- Fixed boiler not being craftable with modded cobblestone-like blocks

Technical Changes:
- Major changes to attributes:
      - The read-only attributes can now be written to
            - If an attribute is set, it will override the player's temperature type that corresponds to that attribute
            - For example, setting the player's cold_sweat:world_temperature to 0 will make the player's world temperature 0 until the attribute is removed
      - Previous "offset" attributes have been removed
      - Core temperature attribute has been removed
- Added new sub-command for /temperature: "modify"
      - Allows for changing the player's temperature attributes
      - Also allows for attributes to be marked as "persistent", meaning they will not be removed upon death


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b02b
- Added "Cold Sweat: Insulators" creative tab
        - Contains all items that can be used as insulation, or provide insulation when worn
- The inside of naturally-generated igloos is now habitable
- Increased hoglin hide drop rate to 1-3 per hoglin killed
- Changed the hearth item texture to better match the block texture
- Chameleon molt dropped from chameleons now lasts 20 minutes before despawning

Fixes:
- Fixed invalid fuel item configs defaulting to "air"
- Fixed the chameleon showing as cold when first spawned
- Fixed temperature attributes breaking when updating to 2.3-b02a
      - This fix will not apply if you've already updated to 2.3-b02a.
      - In worlds on 2.3-b02a with broken attributes, run "/temp modify @s clear" to reset your attributes
- Fixed the soulspring lamp losing its fuel when updating from existing pre-2.3 worlds
- Fixed negative heat/cold dampening values not working properly

Technical Changes:
- Added support for adding item insulation, block temperature, and biome temperature using JSON
      - These are a more modular way of configuring things, without having to add them to the config files
      - These can be defined by developers or via datapacks:
            - Insulation: resources/data/<yourmod>/cold_sweat/insulatorData
            - Block Temps: .../block_temp
            - Biome Temps: .../biome_temp
            - Dimension Temps: .../dimension_temp
            - More datapack support is planned for future versions.
- Added config option for setting the temperature of natural structures
      - This controls the world temperature when the player is inside the structure
- Added config option to allow certain blocks to be slept on regardless of the outside temperature
- Most item configs now support defining NBT tags (i.e. {Color:"blue"}).
      - Item configs with NBT tags defined will require the specified NBT data to be present on the item
- Moved the "Cold Soul Fire" and "Check Sleep Conditions" settings to world-settings.toml
- Renamed some too-verbose config settings/sections


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b02c
- Added new "compact" view for insulation tooltips with 10 bars of insulation or more
- Added better support for netherite diving gear from Create
      - When wearing a full diving set with a filled backtank, the armor will provide 999 heat insulation per piece (near-immunity)
      - This leverages the new entity predicate system added in this update
      - The backtank will now drain air (and show the time indicator) when the player is in a hot environment

Fixes:
- Fixed items not being stackable after opening an inventory screen
- Fixed crash when opening an icebox or boiler without a smokestack on top
- Fixed crash due to null item slots with some mod combinations
- Fixed crash when a chameleon molts in some cases
- Fixed broken compat with Weather, Storms, and Tornadoes (Weather2)
- Fixed snowfall causing the player to become wet if Serene Seasons is installed
- Fixed references to burning_point and freezing_point being swapped in some cases
- Fixed the burning_point attribute not having a description

Technical Changes:
- Added support for checking player data to conditionally enable insulation
      - Insulation items with this predicate will only provide insulation if the player has the specified data
      - Deactivated insulation items can still be equipped, but will not provide insulation or show in the tooltip
      - This is a brand new system, but is structured like a Vanilla entity predicates with some slight tweaks


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b02d

Fixes:
- Fixed crash when Create is not installed
- Fixed item still not stacking properly in some cases


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b02e

Fixes:
- Fixed armor insulation being cleared when opening the creative inventory on a dedicated server
- Fixed minimum and maximum habitable temperatures being swapped in some logic
      - This fixes the bug that prevents players from sleeping
- Fixed server crash when using conditionally-insulated items
- Fixed some config settings not syncing to clients on servers
- Fixed crash when hovering over armor tooltips in some cases
- Fixed abnormally high lag caused by Create compat

Technical Changes:
- Added support for adding custom attributes to insulation items using JSON
      - Attributes will be applied to the player's armor
      - Any attributes (even Vanilla and modded ones) are supported


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b03a
- The soulspring lamp can now be given one fuel item at a time by right-clicking
- Chameleons can now be right-clicked to be given items
      - This is also a way of ensuring which chameleon will eat the item if there are multiple nearby. The dropped item will be marked with the chameleon's UUID
- Added an empty tag remover that fixes existing items affected by the item stacking bug from previous versions

Fixes:
- Fixed cold fuel items not working in the hearth or icebox
- Fixed the soulspring lamp not recharging when given fuel
- Fixed goats not dropping fur on death
- Fixed malformed JSON file for the Home Sweet Home advancement
- Fixed the smokestack not being mineable with a pickaxe
- Fixed the tooltip for temperature-affecting foods being formatted incorrectly
- Fixed clientside mixin (MixinPickEntity) trying to load on the server
- When a chameleon is fed an item that makes it search for a biome, the search is now done on a separate thread to prevent stalling the server thread
      - This means there is no longer a noticeable lag spike when a chameleon attempts to find a biome
- Fixed chameleons' death messages not showing the cause of death in some cases
- Fixed other issues with chameleons locating biomes

Technical Changes:
- Data-driven stuff can now be defined in Cold Sweat's config folder (config/coldsweat/data)
      - This allows users to define their own data without having to make a datapack
- Added data-driven options for the several configs:
      - Fuel items
      - Structure temperatures
      - Food temperatures
      - Insulating mounts
- Added block tags for hearth spread whitelist/blacklist (cold_sweat:tags/block/hearth/spread_whitelist and spread_blacklist)
- Added block tag for blocks that should ignore sleeping conditions (cold_sweat:tags/block/ignore_sleep_check) (ignore the "Check Sleeping Conditions" setting)
- Added item tag for non-insulatable armor items (cold_sweat:tags/item/not_insulatable)
- Added effect tag for blacklisted potion effects in the hearth (cold_sweat:tags/mob_effect/hearth_blacklisted)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b03b
- Improved the output formatting for the /temp debug command

Fixes:
- Fixed the thermometer not displaying temperature units when in an item frame
- Fixed improper conversions between units of temperature in some cases
- Slightly modified unit conversions to use more sensible numbers
      - Previously, arbitrary numbers like 42 and repeating numbers like 23.333... were used
      - Conversions now:
            - MC to C: x * 25
            - MC to F: x * 45 (+ 32 if absolute measurement)
      - Some config settings defined in MC units (like min/max temp) might be slightly off now until they are reset
- Fixed crash with certain mods that edit tooltips when advanced tooltips is enabled
- Fixed inconsistencies between item/entity predicates (Vanilla) and item/entity requirements (Cold Sweat)
- Removed the empty tag remover, as it was causing unforeseen issues with some items

Technical Changes:
- Temperature.Type and Ability have been merged together into Trait
      - These two things were functionally identical anyway, so separating them only made them more annoying to work with
      - This also means that previous Temperature.Ability types can now have TempModifiers applied to them
- The TempModifier registration system has been slightly changed:
      - The ID for TempModifiers is no longer provided by a method in the TempModifier class
      - IDs are now assigned at registration via ResourceLocations like most other things
- The Temperature.addModifier() method will now add/replace for every TempModifier instance that matches the given predicate if allowDupes is true
- Added range field to BlockTemp JSONs


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b03c
- Removed the Insulated effect from the list of top-tier beacon effects
- Added structure temperature offset config option

Fixes:
* Fixed TempModifiers stacking in cases where they shouldn't
* Fixed crash when saving configs or closing the config menu
- (1.19, 1.20) Fixed special minecarts splitting into multiple items when destroyed

Technical Changes:
* Added JSON config for entity spawn biomes


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b03d
* Tamed chameleons can now be bred using their normal taming items (fish, spider eye), but only once
      - This is to make chameleons slightly easier to obtain, and help with potential scarcity on large servers
      - Baby chameleons shed chameleon molt immediately upon turning in to an adult, but otherwise don't
- Chameleons now drop 1 chameleon molt when killed, except if they are a baby
- Made baby chameleons slightly smaller

Fixes:
* Fixed crash when displaying item tooltips in some cases
* Fixed server configs not syncing to clients in many cases
* Fixed the temperature inside generated structures being freezing cold if not defined in the configs
* Fixed fuel items not working properly in the icebox
- Fixed the hearth not insulating in some cases in which it should
- Fixed adaptive insulation not adapting or protecting properly
- Fixed the icebox and boiler not draining fuel when equipped with a smokestack
- Fixed armor insulation tooltip not displaying the correct amount of insulation in some cases

Technical Changes:
* Config settings for biomes, dimensions, structures, and items have much more robust logging and are less prone to failure in cases where the option is malformed


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b03e
- Added config setting to change the drop rate of chameleon molt
- Slightly decreased the rate at which chameleons shed

Fixes:
* Fixed another crash related to item tooltips
- Fixed some config settings for things like biomes, dimensions, and structures not loading or working properly in some cases
- Fixed the "offset" field of structure temperature JSONs not working
- Fixed tags not working for dimension or structure-related config settings

Technical Changes:
* Changed the order of precedence for config settings:
      - user datapacks (in config folder) > datapacks (from mods or worlds) > traditional configs (.toml files)
- Config settings can now accept a comma-separated list of biomes, dimensions, or structures to apply the same settings to multiple things
* (1.16) 3rd party mods can now define datapack configs for Cold Sweat, as has been possible in other versions
      - This is done with a custom data loading system, which means there are a couple minor differences in folder structure:
            - Data files are kept in data/cold_sweat/config/* instead of data/<yourmod>/cold_sweat/*
            - Otherwise, the internal structure is the same
            ! Datapacks in world folders still can't be read by this system. The alternative is to put datapack configs in configs/coldsweat/data/*


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b03f
- Added more info about the filled waterskin's uses to its tooltip

Fixes:
- Fixed config settings for chameleon spawn biomes being loaded too late, preventing them from spawning at all
- Fixed error in determining whether it was snowing or raining if Serene Seasons was installed
- Fixed crash when combining items in the sewing table in some cases
- Fixed crash that rarely occurs when equipping armor items
- Fixed crash when hovering an item with advanced tooltips enabled
- Fixed the icebox GUI background being darker than normal


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b04a
* (1.20) Added Origins integration as a standalone mod:
      - Allows for users to modify the attribute values that players spawn with for origins via datapacks or config files
      - This could already be done for your own origins via attribute modifiers, but this addon is useful for modpack devs
* Changed the functionality of waterskins slightly:
      - The drink function is now performed by crouching and right-clicking
      - The pour function has returned to being the default right-click action
      - Removed the extra "When Swung" tooltip, as both actions can be considered "consuming" the item
* The body temperature readout is now re-implemented as a feature of the thermometer
      - It is hidden by default, and shows when the player has a thermometer or "Require Thermometer" is disabled
      - The body temperature icon now moves out of the way when the readout is displayed (configurable)
- Added the option for food items to change the player's temperature for a period of time, like soul sprouts
      ! The soul sprout will lose this effect until item-settings.toml is reset
- Increased the duration of the soul sprout's effect to 1 minute
- The soulspring lamp now emits particles while in use to help signify its area of effect
- Updated the high-contrast variants of the body and vague world temperature icons
* The following config settings are now configurable for a range, instead of just on/off:
      - Freezing hearts: Ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 freezing all hearts
      - Chilled mining speed: Ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 preventing the player from mining completely
      - Chilled movement speed: Ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 preventing the player from moving completely
      - Chilled knockback reduction: Ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 nullifying the player's knockback to other entities
      - Heatstroke fog: Ranges from 0 to infinity; Controls the distance of the fog, with infinity disabling it altogether
      * These settings now have entries in the config menu as well
- Made heatstroke camera swaying more aggressive

Fixes:
* Fixed the boiler not heating up waterskins if the temperature rate isn't set to a multiple of 1
- Fixed the tooltip for temperature-affecting foods sometimes being in the wrong place
- Fixed the /temp debug command sometimes misreporting the player's temperature and how it is being affected
- Fixed the /temp debug command giving an error for any trait that doesn't have a corresponding attribute type
- Fixed the config settings for body and world temperature gauge position overlapping their label if the text is too long
- Fixed the ice resistance potion recipe accepting any potion as input instead of just awkward potions
- Fixed uncommon crash when closing the config menu
- Fixed visual bug with frozen hearts if the player's max health is not 20
- Fixed frozen-over hearts still rendering when the config setting was disabled
- (1.16) Fixed the body temperature icon rendering in front of the vague world temperature (frame around the body icon)
- (1.16) Fixed the soulspring lamp not affecting nearby players
- (1.16) Fixed frozen-over hearts not rendering

Technical Changes:
- All methods that add/remove/replace TempModifiers now have more advanced options for handling duplicates:
      - This replaces the old "allowDupes" parameter
      - ALLOW: Allows duplicates of this TempModifier to exist on the entity
      - BY_CLASS: Adding/replacing a TempModifier fails if one of the same class is already present
      - EXACT: Adding/replacing a TempModifier fails if there is an instance of the same class and matching NBT present
      ! The old methods with the "allowDupes" parameter are still present, but are now deprecated and marked for removal in a future version


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!! Config settings for blocks will be reset in this version due to restructuring

2.3-b04b
- A complete netherite diving suit (Create) now provides complete resistance to block-related temperature (like lava!)
      - It also gives 100% resistance to overheating, so your temperature will not increase
      - These effects last until the backtank is empty
- Waterskins are now fillable from cauldrons
- Lava cauldrons now emit heat by default
      ! This will not take effect until the config setting for block temperatures is reset

Fixes:
* Fixed the armor insulation tooltip not showing when it should if the item is is also an insulator itself
- Fixed the text for the "Difficulty" button in the config menu not showing correctly after changing a setting
* Fixed crash when exiting the config menu sometimes
* Fixed the charm slot not being available for the thermometer unless it is added by another mod
- Fixed the "Inhospitable" advancement being made immediately upon spawning
* Fixed the player's TempModifiers being reset to default when rejoining the world
- Fixed players being made wet by water and rain while in spectator mode
- Fixed crash caused by goat model mixin
- Fixed data-driven insulator files being added to the TOML configs when saving the game or closing the config menu
* Fixed attribute modifiers on insulation items only working for Cold Sweat attributes
- Fixed attributes added by insulation items being in a random order in the item's tooltip
* Fixed data-driven insulator features like predicates, attribute modifiers, etc. not working for curios
- Fixed item requirements for insulation items being satisfied by an empty slots
- (1.16) Fixed incorrect loot table breaking drops for llamas
- (1.16) Fixed texture inconsistencies between sheared and unsheared llamas
- (1.16) Fixed soul sprouts being consumed when placed into the same slot as any other item

Translation Updates:
* Added Dutch translation (thank Nerbzzz/Nikki!)

Technical Changes:
* Insulation items can now affect non-player entities
      - If an insulation item has special properties, like attribute modifiers, it will now apply to any entity, not just players
* Insulation items can now make entities immune to certain TempModifiers
      - This reduces the efficacy of the specified TempModifiers on the entity
      - The the entity requirement must be met for immunity to be applied
- Replaced TempModifierEvent.Calculate.Pre and Post with more useful events:
      - Override: Fires before the TempModifier is calculated, and allows the incoming temperature to be changed
            - If the event is canceled, the TempModifier's output will be overridden with the event's temperature until it is calculated again
            - Otherwise, the event's temperature is passed into the TempModifier for calculation
      - Modify: Fires after the TempModifier is calculated, and allows the resulting function to be modified
            - The event is not cancelable


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b04c
- Added custom filling and pouring sounds for the waterskin
- Waterskins can now be used to fill a cauldron

- Fixed missing subtitles for hearth-like blocks running out of fuel
- Fixed missing subtitles for filling/emptying a waterskin


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b04e

Fixes:
- Fixed the mod failing to load due to duplicate sound registries
- Fixed redundant attribute modifier queries on the player's armor causing unnecessary performance impact
- Fixed chameleons being added to biomes that should instead spawn goats or llamas

Technical Changes:
- Config settings can now be declared to require a RegistryAccess when saving/loading (see ConfigSetings.java)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b04f
- Due to many configs requiring access to world registries, the Cold Sweat config button is now disabled in the main menu

Fixes:
- Fixed crash due to missing library

Fixes:
- Fixed adaptive insulation not displaying adaptation state on the client


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b05a
* New (experimental?) ice changes:
      * The hearth & icebox now no longer accept water by default
            - Now, the primary cold fuel source is ice
      * Ice is now much easier to obtain/farm, due to a few key changes:
            - Ice now freezes/thaws according to Cold Sweat's temperature system
            - This new system takes altitude, time, and the season into account
            - Ice freezes at roughly 32 °F (0 °C)
            - Ice can now be obtained with a stone pickaxe without silk touch
                  - An iron pickaxe is required for packed ice and blue ice
                  - If ice is mined with a wooden pickaxe or by hand, it will turn into water as normal
            - Packed and Blue ice can now be un-crafted into their "lower-level" variants (i.e. blue ice yields packed ice) in the crafting table or stonecutter
                  - The crafting table yields 4 ice blocks, while the stonecutter yields 9
* The set bonus for Three-Bolt armor from Aquamirae now provides some freezing protection, as well as water immunity
* Added support for Spoiled:
      - Placing food items in the icebox will stop food spoilage as long as it is fueled
      - This will gradually drain fuel from the icebox
- The hearth's texture has been reverted to its pre-2.3 version (doesn't it look so friendly?)
- The hearth's recipe has been tweaked to require less nether bricks, and soul sand instead of basalt

Fixes:
* Fixed block temperatures multiplying in effectiveness every time the player logs in/out of a world
* Fixed the smithing table clearing insulation when upgrading diamond armor to netherite
* Fixed the recipe for ice resistance potion not appearing in JEI
* Fixed players' settings for hearth particle visibility not being saved when changing dimensions or re-logging
* Fixed the "Temperature Offset" config not allowing negative numbers
- Fixed chameleons being marked as un-breedable after being fed a breeding item, even if they didn't actually create a baby
- Fixed the player being able to attack a chameleon mounted on their head in some cases
- Fixed item IDs not being parsed properly in JSON configs
- Fixed nether portals sometimes making the area colder than it should be in the Nether
- Fixed the insulation tooltip showing before the item's name if the tooltip is only 1 line long and Iceberg is installed
- Fixed occasional desync between server and client when a player puts on or takes off a chameleon

Technical Changes:
* Any field in a JSON config that accepts a registry ID, or list of IDs, such as structures, biomes, blocks, etc. can now accept tags
      - Tags and IDs can essentially be used interchangeably, with tags being prefixed with a '#' symbol


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3-b05a.1

Fixes:
- Fixed issues with mixin conflicts & mixins not properly loading in some cases


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3
* Added config option for armor insulation slots to dynamically scale based on protection value:
      - There are 4 modes: Static (no scaling), Linear, Exponential, and Logarithmic
      - A maximum number of slots can be set to prevent excessive scaling
* Added JSON-only config option to customize how world temperature behaves undergorund
      - This system is defined in "regions", in which the temperature can be set to a specific value or follow a gradient
      - By default, the world consists of 3 regions (this replicates how the old system worked):
            - From ground level to 4 block below ground, the temperature is unchanged
            - From 5 blocks 20 blocks, the temperature gradually reaches 75 °F (24 °C)
            - From 20 blocks onward, the temperature is 75 °F (24 °C)
* Hearth-like blocks (including the boiler and icebox) now require redstone power to emit heat/cold
      - While one of these blocks are powered, they will constantly heat/cool the area and consume fuel
      - The thermolith can be used to detect the nearby temperature and power these blocks dynamically
      * A config option has been added to re-enable the "smart" behavior of these blocks
      - If a hearth is powered from the sides, it will cool the nearby area
      - If a hearth is powered from the back, it will heat the nearby area
      - Powering a hearth from both areas will make it heat and cool
      - Powering a boiler or icebox from any side will make it heat or cool, respectively
- Added support for using a Create display link on the thermolith
      - The current world temperature will be displayed
      - A field will be added upon placing the display link that allows the user to define the temperature units
* The icebox now has an animation/sounds when being used, opening like a chest
- The icebox now has a unique texture for when a smokestack is placed on top
- Right-clicking the thermometer now displays the world temperature if Supplementaries in installed
- The thermolith now provides direct power, allowing it to send the signal through blocks
- Updated the hearth's item texture and recipe to be consistent with its block form
- Ice and snow now have slightly lower fuel values in the icebox and hearth

Fixes:
- Fixed attribute modifiers failing to parse in non-English locales, causing world loading to fail
- Fixed steam particles not rendering
- Fixed crash when clicking unformatted text in chat
- Fixed the hearth's AOE still showing after the block is removed by unconventional means

Technical Changes:
* Added an automatic config updater, which will change existing config settings when updating to new versions
     - This prevents outdated config settings causing new features to not work as intended
     - This system will be used very sparingly, and only triggers once


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.1
* The hearth now has visible redstone inputs on the sides and back, to make it more clear how it is powered
- Hearth-like blocks can now be powered from the bottom
      - For the Hearth, this is an additional input for heating
- Updated Thirst Was Taken compat to support 1.3.8+
      - TWT versions below 1.3.8 will now have compat disabled
- Ice how has a minimum temperature, reducing the likelihood of extremely cold (negative) temperatures when standing close to it
- The trident's riptide ability can now be used when the player is wet
      - Using this removes the player's "wetness"

Fixes:
* (1.16) Fixed mixins not loading, causing a lot of strange behavior
* Fixed the player's attributes being set to incorrect values when updating form 2.2
* Fixed the insulation value for chameleon molt being removed when updating from 2.2
* Fixed the player's temperature & world temperature sometimes appearing to not change after respawning
- Fixed missing subtitles for the icebox's opening and closing sounds
- Fixed ice melting into water when broken in creative mode or no block was beneath it
- Fixed the chameleon being immune to neutral damage (not directly from an entity) when not riding a player
- (1.16) Fixed UI icons rendering over the chat panel
- (1.16) Fixed the UI for the hearth, icebox, and boiler being offset when the player has potion effects
- Fixed inconsistency in the freezing screen shake effect at different framerates

Technical Changes:
* Added config setting to nullify all negative temperature effects when the game is set to Peaceful mode
      - This setting replaces the "Damage Scaling" setting, as it didn't work well anyway
* Added new JSON config setting allowing items carried in the player's inventory to apply temperature effects
      - A simplified version of this has also been added to item_settings.toml for quick access
* Added config to change the general strength of insulation items
      - This setting applies to all armor and insulators, changing their effectiveness by a given multiplier


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.2
!! (1.16) The config setting for llama spawn biomes will be deleted and replaced with goat spawn biomes. Please back up before launching!

- Added config option to hide insulation tooltips unless shift is held
* (1.16) Backported goats from 1.18
      - Replicate the appearance and behavior of Vanilla goats
      - If Caves and Cliffs Backport is installed, all Cold Sweat goats will be replaced with that mod's goats
            - This is to keep things simpler by only having one kind of goat
            - As much data as possible will be preserved when replacing (name, age, health, etc)
      - They are now the intended way of obtaining goat fur
      ! If this introduces bugs, I swear I'm gonna revert this stuff
* (1.16) Llamas no longer yield goat fur
- Renamed all fur-related items to "goat fur"
      - Existing items and configs will be automatically updated to reflect this change
* Added screen effect for when the player is wet
      - Can be disabled via an option in the config menu or in client.toml

Fixes:
* Fixed crash when putting a smokestack on the icebox or boiler
* Fixed crash when saving configs in the config screen
- Fixed crash when placing redstone near a hearth, boiler, or icebox in some cases
- (1.16 - 1.19) Fixed the icebox still not having subtitles for opening and closing
- (1.21) Fixed crash when equipping a non-armor item (like the elytra)
- Fixed hearth-like blocks providing chilling/warming when powered but not fueled
- Fixed the Create netherite diving gear having incorrect heat and cold protection values
- Fixed mixin conflict with MemoryLeakFix

Translation Changes:
- Added Traditional Chinese (zh_tw) translation, courtesy of yichifauzi on GitHub

Technical Changes:
- Any drinkable item can now be put in the boiler if Thirst Was Taken is installed, removing the need for the "boiler_purifiable" tag
- The config for carried item temperatures now has an optional "max_effect" field that limits how much that type of item can affect the player


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.3
- Updated the hearth's item texture slightly to match its new block texture

Fixes:
* Fixed crash when the player is wet and GUI scaling is set to "Auto"
- Fixed the hearth still accepting water if the config settings had not been updated from a previous version
- Fixed erratic walking behavior for chameleons, especially when bumping into other mobs
- Fixed the chameleon's walking animation clipping into the ground slightly
- Fixed items thrown to a chameleon having different NBT when picked up, making them unstackable
- Fixed chameleons accepting infinite breeding items in some cases
- Fixed baby chameleons attempting to go into breeding mode when fed breeding items
- Fixed the water dripping effect persisting on-screen after the player has completely dried off


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.4
- Create fluid pipes now connect to the top of the hearth
- Entities can now be configured to affect ambient temperature
      - This config is in entity-settings.toml or as JSON under entity/entity_temp/
- Added a tooltip explaining that game-altering settings in the config menu are disabled for non-OP players
- Added a tooltip to insulated armor items that shows which attributes come from insulation
- Added config setting to disable Cold Sweat's custom water freezing behavior

Fixes:
* (1.16) Fixed crash when Caves and Cliffs is not installed
* (1.16 - 1.18) Fixed the player getting wet when it is snowing and serene seasons is installed
* Fixed the soulspring lamp not consuming fuel
- Fixed Thirst Was Taken support not activating when the mod is installed
- Fixed Serene Seasons's seasonal temperatures applying to non-whitelisted dimensions in some cases
- Fixed block, dimension, structure, and biome tags not working properly in JSON configs
- Fixed temperature-affecting blocks behaving strangely when their max temperature is reached
- Fixed the world temperature gauge representing temperate temperatures inaccurately when the player has extreme min or max temperature traits
- Fixed water not accurately using the current season to determine freezing behavior
- Fixed soul fire and soul campfire not respecting the "Cold Soul Fire" config setting
- Fixed hearth-like blocks giving insulating effects to players 1 block outside its area-of-effect
- Fixed hover tooltips for temperature units in /temp debug not working properly

Technical Changes:
* Items, blocks, entities, etc. can now have multiple config setting applied to them
      - This, for example, allows multiple settings with different conditions and effects to be applied
      - If multiple valid settings are found, they will either stack or override each other depending on the object
* Changed the load order of configs & custom registries to be more consistent and sensible:
      - User JSON configs (config/coldsweat/data/*)
      - Java-based configs (BlockTemps only)
      - Datapack JSON configs (data/<namespace>/cold_sweat/*)
      - User TOML configs (config/coldsweat/*.toml)
      - Configs loaded first will take precedence in cases where they do not stack, such as block temps and fuel items
* Added new fields to depth temperature JSON configs:
      - "required_mods": A list of mods that must be installed for the config to be loaded
      - "dimensions": A list of dimensions or tags that the config will apply to
* Added many new dynamic dimension tags (1.18+):
      * These tags are dynamically filled, meaning they should work for all modded dimensions regardless of support
      - #forge:bed_works: If beds are usable in the dimension
      - #forge:has_ceiling: If the dimension has a ceiling (i.e. the Nether)
      - #forge:has_raids: If pillager raids can occur in the dimension
      - #forge:has_sky: Inverse of #forge:has_ceiling. If dimension has an open sky
      - #forge:has_skylight: If the dimension has ambient light
      - #forge:natural: If the dimension is considered "natural"
      - #forge:overworld_like: If the dimension is similar to the Overworld (has_sky, has_skylight, and natural)
      - #forge:piglin_safe: If piglins will not zombify in the dimension
      - #forge:respawn_anchor_works: If respawn anchors are usable in the dimension
      - #forge:ultrawarm: If the dimension is extremely hot (i.e. the Nether)
      - #forge:unnatural: Inverse of #forge:natural
* Added new arguments for TOML-based block temp configs:
      - nbt: Optional. The block entity's NBT data must match this to apply the temperature (fails the check if the block has no block entity)
      - max-temp: Optional. The maximum world temperature at which the block temp will be effective. If the block's temperature is negative, this will be the minimum temperature
- Added max_temp and min_temp fields to block temp JSON configs
- Block temperatures for ice blocks, boiler, icebox, and campfires have been moved to TOML rather than Java
      - They will be automatically re-added to world_settings.toml
- Optimized the hearth's spreading algorithm
- Optimized the performance of non-player temperature-affected entities
- Any block tagged as #minecraft:ice will now cool the nearby area like Vanilla ice blocks
- Any block tagged as #minecraft:campfires will now heat the nearby area like Vanilla campfires (except for the soul campfire)
- TempModifiers are no longer synced to the client if a modifier is replaced with an identical one


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.5
!! (1.21 only) Due to a change in how armor insulation is saved/loaded, insulation data will be lost upon upgrading from a previous version.<br>It is recommended that you temporarily remove all insulation on your armor before upgrading!

* Added an indicator to the screens of hearth-like blocks that shows if the block is being powered
- Wind, sandstorms, and tornadoes from Weather 2 will now affect the player's temperature
- Increased the maximum volume of the hearth's effect from 9000 to 12000 blocks
- Increased the maximum volume of the icebox & boiler's effect from 1500 to 2000 blocks
- Added a config option to change the effectiveness of the soulspring lamp at temperatures above the player's burning point

Fixes:
* Fixed crash when attempting to update config settings with invalid formatting
* Fixed crash when a boiler/icebox containing waterskins attempts to tick when the temperature rate is set to 0
* Fixed config-driven features stacking in effectiveness when entering multiple worlds in the same session
* Fixed hearth-like blocks' effects applying inconsistently depending on the player's position
* Fixed temperature not changing properly when the player travels underground
* Fixed config settings loading too late during world load, causing custom entity spawns (including chameleons) to not load
* Fixed adaptive insulation not adapting to the ambient temperature
- Fixed the insulation tooltip not displaying partial, negative, or large
- Fixed Spoiled compatibility causing "containerModifier" blocks defined in the Spoiled configs to not work properly
* Fixed hearth-like blocks forgetting that they are powered upon unloading and reloading the chunk

- Fixed hearth-like blocks not affecting areas next to solid blocks properly in some cases
- Fixed the tooltip for food temperature always showing, even if the item has no temperature properties
- Fixed performance issues while rendering the "wetness" screen effect
- Fixed the description of "Knockback Chill" stating received knockback is reduced, rather than dealt knockback
- Fixed JSON configs containing entity requirements not properly checking dimension or biome when specified
- Fixed the wetness screen effect appearing dark when the player has night vision
- (1.20) Fixed the held item name text overlapping the player's body temperature icon when a thermometer is equipped
- (1.21) Fixed invalid formatting for the hearth's recipe causing it to be uncraftable
- (1.21) Fixed dynamic dimension_type tags not populating
- (1.16) Fixed "dimensions" field erroneously being named "dimension" in dimension temp JSON configs
- (1.16 - 1.19) Fixed JSON block temp configs not having min_temp or max_temp fields
- (1.18 - 1.19) Fixed the tooltip lines for attribute modifiers added by armor insulation rendering behind the tooltip

Technical Changes:
* Food temperature configs now stack when applied to the same item, rather than only using the first one loaded
* Renamed some field names for JSON configs to be more consistent:
      - All entity requirement fields are named "entity"
      - All item requirement fields are named "data"
      - Affected configs: food, insulator, mount
* Biome temperatures and offsets now stack, rather than override, when applied to the same biome
      - Dimension temperatures/offsets still override each other, meaning dimension temps still override everything
* Temperature region changes:
      - Moved from /depth_temp/ to /temp_region/
      - Temperature regions now support y-values outside the world limits
      - Temperature regions now support "boundless" temp regions by omitting either the "top" or "bottom" bound
            - These apply infinitely upward or downward (but not both), and have a constant temperature
* Java-based block temperatures are now loaded last to allow user configs to override them
      - A registerFirst() method has been added to BlockTempRegisterEvent for BlockTemps that must break this rule and be registered first


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.6
- Particles spawned by Cold Sweat are now dependent on the player's particle setting (All/Decreased/Minimal)

Fixes:
* (1.21) Fixed crash when saving insulated armor items
* (1.20) Fixed crash when Serene Seasons 9.1 or newer is installed
      - Serene Seasons support now requires version 9.1 or newer to be enabled
* (1.20 - 1.21) Fixed debug message when a tooltip containing adaptive insulation is displayed
- Fixed the world temperature indicator briefly displaying incorrectly when changing preferred units
- Fixed spectators getting wet in water
- Fixed being underwater counting as "underground" when calculating world temperature

Translation Updates:
* Added Japanese translation (Mohuzato on GitHub)

Technical Changes:
- (1.20) Dropped NeoForge support in favor of normal Forge, which is receiving more updates
- Removed the "Cave Insulation Strength" config setting, as it is no longer used
